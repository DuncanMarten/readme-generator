  ## Description
  This application was created to help the user quickly create a readme.md document for their application or project. It helps the user by quickly asking them to enter information for each section of the readme including title, description, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions. Following the prompt about the application the user will also be prompted to give Github username and email address for contact.  After the user completes the questions the application will tell them the readme was created and they can look at the readme output in the dist folder in the application.  The readme contains all the information provided plus a badge representing the license, a link to the actual legal letter for the license, a link to the authors GitHub page, and link to authors email address. Now the user has a fully functioning readme that they can do anything with and is editable if mistakes were made during the prompts.

  ## Installation
  To install this application you will need to go to (https://github.com/DuncanMarten/readme-generator) and clone my code onto your computer. Then make sure you have nodejs and inquirer downloaded on your computer. Finally you should be able to test to see if the application works by typing node index.js into the command-line.

  ## Usage
  To use the application all you need to do is typed nodejs into the command-line and answer all the prompts.  You can see the process and explanation in this video (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eXpGRzil5R17rQ5klTwT_EFCQy6eIQDq/view).

  ## Contributing
  If you would like to contribute on this project, I just ask that you contact me first and recieve my permission. Please do not destroy my code just add to it if needed.

  ## Tests
  To test this application all you need to do is prompt the application to start in the command-line and check to see if the validations for the questions works and if the text you write appends to the corresponding section in the readme. The only other part to test is if the badge works and all links work.
